# StockStalker - A Machine Learning-based Stock Price Movement Prediction Web Application

## 1.	Introduction

Algorithmic trading is a method of executing large order (too large to execute all at once) using automated per-programmed trading instructions accounting for a variety of variables such as time, price and volume to send smaller slices (child orders) out to the market over time. They were developed so that traders do not need to constantly watch the stock and repeatedly send slices out manually. Popular algorithms include Percent of Volume, Pegged, VWAP, TWAP, Implementation Shortfall, and Target Close.
Algorithm trading is widely used by investment banks, pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds and other buy-side (investor-driven) institutional traders. It is a way to minimize the cost, market impact and risk in execution of an order.
