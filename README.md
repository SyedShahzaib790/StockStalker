StockStalker is a web application which predicts the stock price movement. The application uses python based web framework named Flask which acts as a bridge between the user interface and prediction model. The application predicts the next hour price movement for a given stock. The prediction mechanism indicates gain or loss of next hour using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Adaboost.There are basic two functionalities which is included in the application which are live data streaming and price prediction. Live data streaming allows the user to view and observe the live data over the specified interval. Prediction price is the core functionality of our application which allows the user to see the next hour price movement. It includes the steps like scraping of data from different sources, data preprocessing for analysis and the final step is to model the preprocessed data using different machine learning algorithms like Random forest, Ada boost, Support Vector Machine etc.

# Technologies Used :
