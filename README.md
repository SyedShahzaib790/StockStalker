# StockStalker - A Machine Learning-based Stock Price Movement Prediction Web Application

## 1.	Introduction

Algorithmic trading is a method of executing large order (too large to execute all at once) using automated per-programmed trading instructions accounting for a variety of variables such as time, price and volume to send smaller slices (child orders) out to the market over time. They were developed so that traders do not need to constantly watch the stock and repeatedly send slices out manually. Popular algorithms include Percent of Volume, Pegged, VWAP, TWAP, Implementation Shortfall, and Target Close. Algorithm trading is widely used by investment banks, pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds and other buy-side (investor-driven) institutional traders. It is a way to minimize the cost, market impact and risk in execution of an order.

## 2.	Project Vision
We envision building a real time stock price prediction system, which will be able to predict the next hour stock price of a particular companyâ€™s stock. We seek to provide the traders or brokers with a unique system to help them to take a trading decision in a more systematic and efficient way.

## 3.	Previous Research

Prediction will continue to be an interesting area of research making researchers in the domain field always desiring to improve existing predictive models. The reason is that institutions and individuals are empowered to make investment decisions and ability to plan and develop effective strategy about their daily and future endeavours.
Stock price prediction is regarded as one of most difficult task to accomplish in financial forecasting due to complex nature of stock market. The desire of many investors is to lay hold of any forecasting method that could guarantee easy profiting and minimize investment risk from the stock market. This remains a motivating factor for researchers to evolve and develop new predictive models. In the past years several models and techniques had been developed to stock price prediction. Among them are artificial neural networks (ANNs) model which are very popular due to its ability to learn patterns from data and infer solution from unknown data. Few related works that engaged ANNs model to stock price prediction are. In recent time, hybrid approaches has also been engaged to improve stock price predictive models by exploiting the unique strength of each of them. ANNs is from artificial intelligence perspectives.
